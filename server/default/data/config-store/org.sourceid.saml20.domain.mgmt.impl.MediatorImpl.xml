        Determines whether to create and configure plugin instances on PingFederate startup and data archive import
        rather than waiting until the first request that uses the plugin. Setting this to true ensures that custom
        endpoints registered by plugins are available as soon as PingFederate starts up. However, in some environments
        this initialization step can dramatically increase start-up time.

        Default configuration:
        <c:item name="ConfigurePluginsOnStartup">true</c:item>
    -->
    <c:item name="ConfigurePluginsOnStartup">true</c:item>
</c:config>
